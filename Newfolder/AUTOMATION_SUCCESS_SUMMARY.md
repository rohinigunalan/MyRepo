   - **Sub-options**: Conditional selection of Student/Educator accounts
   - **Excel Control**: Based on close_student & close_educator Excel columns
   - **Logic**: Smart conditional selection based on Excel data

### 3. 🎯 Enhanced Request Type Mapping
   - **2-Step Process**: Exact matching first, then keyword fallback
   - **Exact Matching**: Prioritizes precise text matches
   - **Keyword Fallback**: Uses keywords when exact match not found
   - **Comprehensive Coverage**: Handles all variations and edge cases

## 📊 Technical Validation:

- **close_student**: Set to "Student account (if any)" to select student option
- **close_educator**: Set to "Educator data (if any)" to select educator option
- **Empty values**: Will skip that sub-option (as demonstrated)
